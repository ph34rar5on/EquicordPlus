# Downloadify

Download various assets directly in Discord without having to open a browser or dig through HTML.

## Features

    - Allow or disallow unicode characters in file names.
    - Various image assets are available in multiple formats as Discord makes converted copies.
    - APNG and AWEBP are presented with the `.apng` and `.awebp` extensions during download in order to differentiate them from static PNG and WEBP variants, but upon download their extensions are converted back to `.png` and `.webp` respectively.
2. Show a notification when downloads start and finish with a customizable duration.
3. Add a download button to voice messages.
4. Set a default directory or pick each time.
    - Pick whether to overwrite existing files or not.
